# python-utils
Python utilities for plotting and SIMPSON integration, work in progress, as always use with caution.
Feel free to use, expand, etc.
Just be careful to retain legacy support (don't break my stuff, please, i need that)

brukerplot:
Wrapper for nmrglue to better support Bruker data. Intended mainly for plotting of 2D data.

SIMPSON:
first steps to build a wrapper to utilize SIMPSON from within python to make data analysis somewhat easier
